### To run this in development mode
* if this is your first time, type "npm install" to install the necessary packages
* in a terminal, type "npm run build" (you only have to do this once)
	* after you do "npm run build", you can use "npm run watch" to continuously watch your html, css, and js files
* in another terminal window, type "npm run serve" (nodemon is installed and watching your every move ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°))
* in your browser, go to localhost:8080
* that is all.
